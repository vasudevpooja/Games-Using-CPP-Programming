# Games Using C++ Programming 

Using C++ programming concepts to develop games such as 2048, Hangman, Ludo, Math Quiz, and Tic Tac Toe.

# [2048](https://github.com/vasudevpooja/Games-Using-CPP-Programming/blob/main/2048/main.cpp)
 • The 2048 Game is based on a concept of colliding the same two numbers to create a new number with the total sum of the two numbers. 
 
 • It is played on a 4×4 grid, with numbers that slide smoothly when a player moves them using the four arrow keys. 
 
 • Every turn, a new number will randomly appear in an empty spot on the board with a value of either 2 or 4. 
 
 • The player has to move the numbers using arrow keys and try to collide the same two numbers which create a new number with the total sum of the two numbers. 
 
 • Numbers slide as far as possible in the chosen direction until they strike on either another number or the edge of the grid.

## Features:

• **Up arrow:** To move upward
 
• **Down arrow:** To move downward
 
• **Left arrow:** To slide the numbers to the left
 
• **Right arrow:** To slide the numbers to the right

# [Hangman](https://github.com/vasudevpooja/Games-Using-CPP-Programming/blob/main/Hangman/main.cpp)
 • Hangman is based on the concept of guessing the correct letters to form the correct word before the chance is over.
 
 • This system is based on the concept of guessing letters (A-Z) to form the words.
 
 • If the player guesses the right letter that is within the word, the letter appears at its correct positions. 
 
 • The user has to guess the correct word until the guessing chance becomes zero, then the game is over.

# [Ludo](https://github.com/vasudevpooja/Games-Using-CPP-Programming/tree/main/Ludo)
Ludo is a strategy board game for two to four players, in which the players race their four tokens from start to finish according to the rolls of a single die. In Turbo C graphics the graphics.h functions are used to draw different shapes like circles, rectangles, etc, display text(any message) in a different format (different fonts and colors). By using graphics.h we can make programs, animations and also games.

## Concepts used:
• **rectangle():** A function from graphics.h header file which draws a rectangle from left to right and from top to bottom.

• **line():** A function from graphics.h header file which draws a line from (a1, b1) point to (a2, b2) point.

• **circle():** A function from graphics.h header file which draws a circle with (a, b) as the center and r as the radius.

• **outtextxy():** A function from graphics.h header file by which we can print any statements where, x, y are the coordinates of the point and, the third argument contains the address of the string to be displayed.

• **settextstyle():** A function from graphics.h header file by which we can make a style of the printable text where the font argument specifies the font of the text. The direction can be HORIZ_DIR () or VERT_DIR (Bottom to top).

• **setfillstyle():** A function from graphics.h header file by which we can give a pattern of drawing and also a specific color.

• **floodfill():** A function from graphics.h header file by which we can color a specific bounded area with (a, b) as the center and c as the border color.on from graphics.h header file by which we can print any statements where, x, y are the coordinates of the point and, the third argument contains the address of the string to be displayed.

• **settextstyle():** A function from graphics.h header file by which we can make a style of the printable text where the font argument specifies the font of the text. The direction can be HORIZ_DIR () or VERT_DIR (Bottom to top).

• **setfillstyle():** A function from graphics.h header file by which we can give a pattern of drawing and also a specific color.

• **floodfill():** A function from graphics.h header file by which we can color a specific bounded area with (a, b) as the center and c as the border color.

# [Math Game](https://github.com/vasudevpooja/Games-Using-CPP-Programming/blob/main/Math%20Quiz/main.cpp)
 • The player can test their calculation skills through this game. 
 
 • The player just has to type the answer within 5 seconds and press enter to check the answer. 
 
 • If the player is right, then he/she will get a score of 10.
 
 • If not, then the system will end the game.
 
 • The game score is shown at last with a high score.

# [Tic Tac Toe](https://github.com/vasudevpooja/Games-Using-CPP-Programming/blob/main/Math%20Quiz/main.cpp)
 • The user has to build a straight horizontal, vertical or diagonal line with their value (either X or O). 
 
 • The player has to play the game turn wise and use some strategy to win the game. 
 
 • The player have to type from 1 to 9 to place the value in the game box.
